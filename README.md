## [💬] "yes, this is she"

Hi! I'm Manahil Rashid Awan, a college junior studying History, Computer science, and Policy @ Sarah Lawrence College as a UWC Davis Scholar. Yeah, I *like* systems, but I **love** people.

[🇵🇰 but 🇦🇪🇯🇵🇺🇸] my life is spread across four countries. if you could guide me on anything, it’d probably be how to stay still.

## [🎯]  this summer, I've been...
**{🌟}** an intern at a refugee resettlement org in San Diego, CA
- designed and developed a demo of 'Uplift,' a project to automate document and notification management for caseworkers so they can focus on people, not papers.
- translated English and Urdu to create clear communication for access to services
- spent an entire afternoon searching (unsuccessfully) through a filing cabinet of hundreds of pages for a single paper notice

**{🌟}** learning mandarin in an intensive beginner's course 
- met for 2 hours a day, 4 days a week for 6 weeks
- learned 10 main lessons: greetings, introductions, progressive present tense, nationalities, date & time, asking for location, food, family & home, clothes, checking the dictionary, and prepositions.

*I'll be spending the rest of the summer...*

- learning japanese to prepare for the upcoming semester & a future study abroad
- brushing up on my python for my cs course
- working on 'Uplift' beyond the demo
